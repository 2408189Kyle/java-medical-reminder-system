#medical-reminder-system

Description / Overview
The Medical Reminder System is a Java console-based application designed to help users
manage their medicines and ensure they take them on time. It allows users to add, view, update,
and delete medicine records, including scheduled reminder times. The system uses
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and a scheduling mechanism to trigger console
notifications at specified times. It solves the problem of forgetting medication by providing daily
reminders and organized record-keeping in a simple and efficient way

Users can:
  Register as a patient
  View health Overview
  Add Prescription
  Mark Dose Taken
  Manage Status
  Delete Prescription
  Calculate USage

#OOP Concepts Applie

Encapsulation - The Medicine class uses private fields (`name`, `dose`, `notes`, and `reminderTimes`) with public
getters and setters. This protects data and ensures values are accessed and modified through controlled methods.

Inheritance - The class ConsoleReminder inherits from the abstract class `Reminder`. It reuses and extends the reminder framework provided by the parent class.

Polymorphism - The `ReminderScheduler` schedules reminders using the superclass `Reminder`, but the actual object is a `ConsoleReminder`. Overridden `notifyUser()` defines how the reminder appears on the console.

Abstraction - The `Reminder` abstract class hides implementation details by requiring subclasses to implement
`notifyUser()`. Only essential behavior (scheduling reminders) is exposed.

We would like to express our gratitude to our instructor for the guidance provided throughout the
development of this project. Their feedback helped us better understand Java and apply OOP
principles effectively. We also thank our groupmates for the teamwork and cooperation that made
this project successful. Finally, online resources—especially Programiz—were helpful in testing
and running our Java program smoothly. This project would not be as polished without
everyone’s support.

Future Enhancements
The current version works well, but several improvements can make the system more powerful:
1. Save Data to File- Allow storing medicines and reminders permanently.
2. Load Data on Startup- Automatically load previously saved medicines.
3. Different Notification Types- Add SMS, email, or pop-up notifications through more
Reminder subclasses.
4. Medicine History Tracking- Log when reminders are triggered and whether the user took the
medicine.
5. Graphical User Interface (GUI) - Replace the console with a simple window-based interface.
6. User Login System-Protect sensitive medical information
