# ⚕️ Medical Reminder System
A comprehensive Java application designed to help users manage their medication schedule, ensuring timely intake and organized record-keeping through both Console-Based and Graphical User Interface (GUI) versions.
# 💡 Project Overview
The Medical Reminder System is built using Java to track medication schedules, providing daily reminders and organized record-keeping. It allows users to register as a patient, add new prescriptions, track dosages, and monitor treatment duration. The application is available in both a simple console interface (Medical.java) and a modern Swing GUI (MedicalGUI.java).✨ Key FeaturesThe system offers complete functionality for medication management:Patient Profile: Register and view the patient's age and gender.Prescription Management: Define medication, dosage, treatment frequency (e.g., "8 hours"), start time, and treatment duration.Tracking & Status: Easily Mark Doses Taken and manage prescription status (Active, Inactive, Completed).Usage Calculation: Project the total number of doses required for a specified period (or the entire treatment duration).Dashboard & Schedule: View a health overview and a detailed schedule of upcoming doses.🛠️ Technologies & Core ConceptsOOP Principles AppliedTo prevent inconsistent alignment caused by varying markdown renderers, this section uses HTML table markup for guaranteed structure:ConceptClass/MechanismDescriptionEncapsulationPatient, MedicinePrivate fields (age, dosage, frequency) with controlled access via public getters and setters protect the integrity of the data.InheritanceTablet, Capsule, OralMedicineThese concrete classes inherit common scheduling and status properties from the abstract superclass Medicine, centralizing core logic.Polymorphismtake() and toString() MethodsSubclasses override the toString() method to display the exact type of medicine, demonstrating how different objects respond to the same method call.AbstractionMedicine (Abstract Class)Defines the essential framework for any medication (e.g., all must implement dose tracking and status) while hiding internal calculation complexities.▶️ Getting StartedTo run the application, ensure you have JDK 8 or newer installed.Project Structure📂 src/
